<h1 id="toy-robot">toy-robot</h1>
<p>toy-robot is a simulator of a toy robot that moves on a tabletop.</p>

<h2 id="licence">licence</h2>

<h3 id="why-the-lgpl">why the LGPL?</h3>
<p>The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD license (and similar) don’t mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed library are required to release source code to that library if they change it.</p>
